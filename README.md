# Stock-price-prediction using LSTM
Machine learning has significant applications in the
stock price prediction. In this machine learning project, I will be talking about predicting the returns on
stocks. This project is developed in two parts:
First, prediction of stock price using the LSTM neural
network.
Then a dashboard is built using Plotly dash for stock
analysis.
To build the stock price prediction model,
NSE TATA GLOBAL dataset is used. This is a dataset of Tata
Beverages from Tata Global Beverages Limited, National
Stock Exchange of India
To develop the dashboard for stock analysis another stock dataset with multiple stocks like Apple,
Microsoft, Facebook is used.
